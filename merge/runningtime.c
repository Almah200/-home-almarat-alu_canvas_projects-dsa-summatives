//Determine the running time of the merge sort algorithm 
The running time of the algorithm as output by the function is:
Running Time: 0.000083 seconds

//what would be the difference in terms of running if the 
//usernames were 10,000 but the program written was a bubble sort.

Bubble sort algorithm would take long running time as it compares first element to 
the second and if they are not inorder they are shifted like that till the end.
its time complexity for best scenario is o(n) when array is sorted and 
average and worst casese are O(n2).
in this case the time complexity if bubble sort is used on 10,000 names 
would be  very large as time time complexity would be O(10000^2).
